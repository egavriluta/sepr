        <h2>CrossFit is EVERYWHERE these days.</h2> 
        <p>You can watch the CrossFit Games on ESPN.  Last night I saw a commercial with CrossFit and Reebok. It's showing up in magazines everywhere and has a huge presence online. If you have friends or coworkers that enjoy working out, you might have even heard them talking about the newest CrossFit ''box'' (gym) that just opened up down the street.</p>
<p>You might be wondering, ''Hey Steve! What the hell is CrossFit, and is it for me?''
</p>
       


        
        <p><i>If you ARE wondering that, my response is ''wow I'm good at reading minds.''  If you WEREN'T wondering that before, you are now..which means I'm good at mind control.  You see, either way I win.</i></p>
<p>But that's neither here nor there.</p>
        
       <p>Anyways...I've been talking with Staci &mdash; a CrossFit Level 1 Trainer, a dedicated CrossFit participant, and the first addition to Team Nerd Fitness (whose first full day is TODAY!) &mdash; over the past few weeks about how we couldn't find a decent ''Beginner's Guide to CrossFit'' anywhere on the Internet that wasn't heavily biased in one direction or the other.  On top of that, any time there's an article that mentions the word CrossFit, a quick trip to the comment section reveals so much support or hatred that it's almost comical.</p>   
       
       <p>Well, rather than wait for that beginner's guide to CrossFit resource to get written, I figured why not write it ourselves?</p>
       <p><b>Let's figure out what CrossFit is, who it's for, how it works, and if you should join your local CrossFit gym.</b></p>
       
       <p>WARNING: At 6,000 words, this is the longest post that has ever appeared on NF.  If you have NO interest in CrossFit, check back in on Monday with your regularly scheduled nerdiness</p>
       
       <p><i>Note &mdash; if you already worship or loathe CrossFit, this article won't change your mind.  Just don't kill me..I like living.  </i></p>
       
       
       
       
       
        
           <p class="lastP"></p> 
             
           <h2>What is CrossFit?</h2>
           <div>
           <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="images/CrossFit02.jpg" title="Cross Fit"><img src="images/CrossFit02.jpg" alt="CrossFit"/></a>
           </div>
    <p><b>CrossFit is advertised, in four words, as ''the sport of fitness.'' </b></p>
           <p>With constantly varied, high-intensity functional movements, CrossFit is a training philosophy that coaches people of all shapes and sizes to improve their physical well-being and cardiovascular fitness in a hardcore yet accepting and encouraging environment.</p>
          <br/>
          
          <p><b>Here's the definition of CrossFit from the official site:</b></p> 
          <p class="rightP"><em>CrossFit is the principal strength and conditioning program for many police academies and tactical operations teams, military special operations units, champion martial artists, and hundreds of other elite and professional athletes worldwide.</em></p>

<p class="rightP"><em>Our program delivers a fitness that is, by design, broad, general, and inclusive. Our specialty is not specializing. Combat, survival, many sports, and life reward this kind of fitness and, on average, punish the specialist.</em></p>

<p class="rightP"><em>CrossFit contends that a person is as fit as they are proficient in each of ten general physical skills: cardiovascular/respiratory endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, agility, balance, coordination, and accuracy</em></p>
           
           <p><b>Or, in nerd speak</b> &mdash; CrossFit is a training program that builds strength and conditioning through extremely varied and challenging workouts.  Each day the workout will test a different part of your functional strength or conditioning, not specializing in one particular thing, but rather with the goal of building a body that's capable of practically anything and everything.</p>

    <p>CrossFit is extremely different from a commercial gym...and not just because you won't find any ellipticals, weight machines (gross), or Zumba classes.  I'll explain what makes CrossFit different later in the article.</p>
           
           <p class="lastP"></p> 
           <h2>Try it!</h2>
           <div>
           <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="images/CrossFit03.png" title="Cross Fit"><img src="images/CrossFit03.png" alt="CrossFit"/></a>
           </div>
           <p>One of my favorite ''first time'' CrossFit workouts is a benchmark workout named Cindy.  It's a simple bodyweight circuit and can be done practically anywhere &mdash; the only equipment you need is a pullup bar.  It's a favorite for travelling, and shorter versions of it (3 rounds) is often used as a warmup.</p>
           
           <h4>Cindy is:</h4>
           <ul>
           <li>20 minute AMRAP (as many rounds as possible)</li>
           <li>5 pullups</li>
           <li>10 pushups</li>
           <li>15 squats</li>
           
           </ul>
           
           
       <p>What this means is that you put 20 minutes on the clock and then, you do as many rounds as possible (AMRAP) of 5 pullups, 10 pushups, and 15 squats before the time runs out. There is no rest in between rounds &mdash; so as soon as you finish your 15 squats you start on the pullups again.</p>    
           <p>Now, lets look at each movement and how to scale it down if necessary.</p>
           <p>5 Pullups &mdash; You're allowed to kip these (which is a useful skill any time that your goal is not pure strength). If you can't do regular pullups, you can do banded pullups, chair assisted pullups, or jumping pullups instead.  Don't have a pullup bar?  Do bodyweight rows.</p>
           
           <p>10 pushups &mdash; The standard CrossFit pushup is chest to the deck, but if you can't do that, you can substitute knee pushups or wall pushups.</p>
        <p><b>There are also other variations of this workout for beginner athletes.  Some examples are:</b></p>
           
           <table>
           <tr>
           <td>AMRAP 20min</td>
           <td>AMRAP 12min</td>
           <td>AMRAP 12 min</td>
           <td>AMRAP 10 min</td>
           </tr>
           
           <tr>
           
            <td>3 Pull-ups</td>
           <td>5 Pull-ups</td>
           <td>1 Pull-ups</td>
           <td>1 Pullup</td>
           
           
           </tr>
           
            <tr>
           
            <td>6 Push-ups</td>
           <td>10 Push-ups</td>
           <td>4 Push-ups</td>
           <td>4 Push-ups</td>
           
           
           </tr>
           
          <tr>
           
            <td>9 Squats</td>
           <td>15 Squats</td>
           <td>7 Squats</td>
           <td>7 Squats</td>
           
           
           </tr> 
           
           </table>
           
          
           <p class="lastP"></p> 
          
          <p>
          Sound too easy? Go faster. While you are getting strength benefits from this workout, the goal of this workout is more metabolic conditioning, so making the movements harder (like switching to divebomber pushups) isn't something you would want to do here.  You can find some of the other benchmark workouts here.</p> 
           
        
        <h2>Can I do it at home?</h2>

        <p><b>Every day, CrossFit.com puts out the a workout of the day (or WOD), which can be done at home, in a commercial gym, or in a CrossFit gym.</b> </p>
        
        
        <p>Every CrossFit gym will put out their own WOD as well, which can be different from the CrossFit.com site &mdash; if you happen to find a local CrossFit site that you enjoy but don't attend fulltime, it's more than okay to follow their workouts.</p>
        
        <p>The best news about this is the workouts are posted free of charge to anybody that is interested in doing them.  There is even a site dedicated to scaling the workout posted on CrossFit.com to account for different abilities. CrossFits are often prohibitively expensive, so if you love CrossFit but are looking to save money, you can follow along at home or in your office gym provided they have the right equipment.</p>
        
        <p>Many times, you'll run into situations where you can't complete a particular workout because you don't have the right equipment &mdash; do the best you can with what's available to you, and keep track of how you made your modification for tracking purposes.</p>
        <p><b>Now, there are a few issues with following CrossFit at home or by yourself in a gym:</b></p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><b>Nobody is checking your form &mdash;</b> CrossFit requires many incredibly specific movements, if you start by yourself at home, you'll never know if you're doing them wrong and could severely hurt yourself as you increase the amount of weights with which you work.</li>
        <li><b>You probably don't have all of the equipment &mdash;</b> If you're working out at home, you probably don't have a full squat rack,  bumper plates, kettlebells, medicine balls, and so on...so you'll often be creating your own workouts that are modified versions of the online versions.</li>
            <li><b>Nobody is cheering you on &mdash;</b> A HUGE part of CrossFit is the supportive community aspect that comes with each gym.  I guarantee you'd finish a workout a few seconds (or minutes) faster if you had 50 people screaming your name and cheering you toward the finish line.</li>
            <li><b>You will want to buy all of the equipment &mdash;</b> The more you do it, the more you'll want to do it properly. This might not cost as much as an actual box, but it will cost.</li>
        
        </ul>
