       <p>
     My own experience in professional sport starts around 6-7 years ago, you know when you’re for a long period in sport you begin to not count the years but keep working and improving yourself. Furthermore to be more specific I’m a professional powerlifter, a strong sport for strong people. My career started at 14 years old and my first competition was at my 15 years world – the National Moldavian Powerlifting Championship, where I won for the first time my first “gold” medal – first place between teenagers with a result of 110kg in BENCH PRESS, 110 in SQUAT and 180 in deadlift. At this time I felt for the first time the smell of victory, when after a hard workout you have the result and this is the most powerful feeling. 
</p>
<p>Sport is like a drug, if you begin to be involved in it you’ll can’t give up. This is because every time when you look in the mirror and realise that you’re bigger and more powerful that motivates you. Moreover when you begin to win some competition building a name that represent the first in that field you can’t be on second position anymore. For instance when I’m skipping the workout I’m always felling guilty, something like I’m not strength enough.  
</p>
        <p>
In my sport career a have around 20-30 professional competition, including national and international contests, in which the majority of them I own the first place. More significant for me where the World and European Championships WDFPF POWERLIFTING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP "SINGLE EVENT 2013 ", Antwerp (Belgium) where I won the gold medal and WDFPF POWERLIFTING EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP "SINGLE EVENT 2013 ", Cherkassy (Ukraine), where I had the same result. This was a nice experience and motivation for me to keep going. For instance during the two competitions mention above I saw one of the oldest sportsmen in our federation that had 81 years world. At this moment I begin to ask myself – What is your excuse?

<p>I was promoting and I’ll promote always a healthy lifestyle. My motto is: “I’m proud to be drug-free” that means I’m never using steroids, anabolic or any other drugs to improve myself – only natural way of training. Because based one my opinion you can reach everything in natural way by working hard, be perseverant, punctual and motivated.  Two of the federation in which I concur also are drug-free, making every time controls to sportsmen verifying them on each single championship. </p>



<p>World Drug-Free Powerlifting Federation based on its name you can mention that this federation promote only natural way of training. The WDFPF was created in 1988 specifically as a drug-free alternative international platform - in order to provide fair competition world-wide for those powerlifters who wish to train and compete without performance-enhancing drugs. This remains as important today as it was when the Federation came into being. In pursuit of this objective the WDFPF has adopted the most rigorous drug control procedures in the world.</p>
        <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="images/myImg/image (3).jpg"> <img src="images/myImg/image (3).jpg" alt="Weightlifting" height="335" width="500" class="rightImg"/></a>
        <p>That same rigour is demanded of all those national organizations affiliated to the WDFPF, as a pre-condition of their registration with the world body. Ours is the only international organization which makes such demands of its members, and this is the true measure of our dedication to the drug-free principle. We firmly believe that there are powerlifters in every part of the world who are sympathetic to the ideals of the WDFPF.</p> <p> Moreover, we believe that drug-free lifters belong in a drug-free organization. It is our mission to develop the sport for our members, to reach out to drug-free powerlifters everywhere, and to increase our international base by bringing them into the WDFPF - where they can be assured that there exists a genuine commitment from all concerned to provide for fair powerlifting competition free from the use of drugs.</p><p> The ultimate success of drug-free powerlifting depends on those who share our ideals being dedicated - not only to the principle of drug-free competition - but to the success of those genuine drug-free organizations which exist to achieve these objectives. Accordingly we welcome all lifters and officials around the world who subscribe to the ideals of the WDFPF, to join our world-wide body and work with us to turn our aspirations into reality.
        
</p>

    <p>In conclusion I can affirm that nothing stands in the way to improve yourself, to be better that other or even to be the first you just have to work hard a follow your dream. </p>
