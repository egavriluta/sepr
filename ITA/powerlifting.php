       <p>
        <b>Powerlifting</b> is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves lifting weights in three attempts. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as odd lifts, which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three.</p>
<p>In competition, lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped (typically referred to as raw lifting or classic in the IPF specifically). Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs. In some federations, knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not un-equipped division; in others, they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting. Weight belts, knee sleeves, wrist wraps and special footwear may also be used, but are not considered when distinguishing equipped from un-equipped lifting. </p>
<p>Competitions take place across the world but mostly in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Iceland, Egypt, Sweden, Finland, Russia and Ukraine. Powerlifting has been a Paralympic sport (bench press only) since 1984 and, under the IPF, is also a World Games sport. Local, national and international competitions have also been sanctioned by other federations operating independently of the IPF.

        <p class="TextTitle">Training</p> 
        <p>Powerlifters practice weight training to improve performance in the three competitive lifts&#8212;the squat, bench press and deadlift. Weight training routines used in powerlifting are extremely varied. For example, some methods call for the use of many variations on the contest lifts, while others call for a more limited selection of exercises and an emphasis on mastering the contest lifts through repetition. While many powerlifting routines invoke principles of sports science, such as specific adaptation to imposed demand (SAID principle).there is some controversy around the scientific foundations of particular training methods, as exemplified by the debate over the merits of "speed work," or training to attain maximum acceleration of submaximal weights.</p>
<p>In addition to weight training, powerlifters may pursue other forms of training to improve their performance. For example, aerobic exercise may be used to improve endurance during drawn-out competitions and support recovery from weight training sessions.

        <p class="TextTitle">Events</p>
        
        <p>In a Competition, there are three events: bench press, squat, and deadlift. Some variations of this are found at some meets such "push-pull only" meets where lifters only compete in the bench press and deadlift, with the bench press coming first and the deadlift after. Single lift meets are often held, sometimes alongside a normal 3-lift event. This is most common in the bench press.</p>
<p>At a meet the events will follow in order: squat, then bench press, and the deadlift will be the final lift of the meet. If the federation also has an event for strict curls this will normally occur before the squat event.

        <p class="TextTitle">Classes and categories</p>
        
        <h2>Weight Classes:</h2>
       <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="images/Powerlifting-pictures.jpg" title="Chempionship"> <img src="images/Powerlifting-pictures.jpg" alt="Powerlifting" height="274" width="350" class="rightImg"/></a>
        <p>
       
            Most powerlifting federations use the following weight classes: <br/><br/>
            <b>Men:</b> 52 kg, 56 kg, 60 kg, 67.5 kg, 75 kg, 82.5 kg, 90 kg, 100 kg, 110 kg,              125 kg, 125 kg + <br/><br/>
            <b>Women:</b> 44 kg, 48 kg, 52 kg, 56 kg, 60 kg, 67.5 kg, 75 kg, 82.5 kg, 90 kg,               90 kg + <br/><br/>
            However, in 2011, the IPF introduced the following new weight classes:
        </p>
        
        <h2>IPF Weight Classes:</h2>
        
        <p>
       <b> Men:</b> up to 53 kg (Sub-Junior/Junior), 59 kg, 66 kg, 74 kg, 83 kg, 93 kg, 105 kg, 120 kg, 120 kg+<br/><br/>
<b>Women:</b> up to 43 kg (Sub-Junior/Junior), 47 kg, 52 kg, 57 kg, 63 kg, 72 kg, 84 kg, 84 kg +
        </p>
        <h2>Age categories</h2>
        <p>
            This depends on the federation generally but averages are as follows:<br/><br/>
15-18 (Sub-Jr), 19-23 (Jr), open (any age), masters (40+)<br/><br/>
The IPF uses the following age categories: sub-junior (18 and under), junior (19-23), open (24-39), masters 1 (40-49), master 2 (50-59), masters 3 (60-69), and masters 4 (70+).<br/><br/>Age category is dependent on the year of the participant's birth. For example, if the participant turns 18 years old in January, he or she is still considered a sub-junior until the end of that calendar year. Other federations typically break the masters categories down to 5-year increments, for example, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, etc.<br/><br/> Some federations also include a sub-master class from 35-39.

        <p class="TextTitle">Competition</p>

        <p>A competition takes place as follows:<br/><br/>Each competitor is allowed three to four attempts on each lift depending on their standing and the organization they are lifting in (usually smallest w-class to heaviest). The lifter's best valid attempt on each lift counts toward his competition total. If two or more lifters achieve the same total, the lighter lifter ranks above the heavier lifter.</p>
        <p>Competitors are judged against other lifters of the same gender, weight class, and age. This helps to ensure that the accomplishments of lifters like Lamar Gant, who has deadlifted 5 times his bodyweight, are recognized alongside those of Benedikt Magnusson, the current All-time deadlift world record holder.</p>
        <p>Comparisons of lifters and scores across different weight classes can also be made using handicapping systems such as the Wilks formula.</p>
